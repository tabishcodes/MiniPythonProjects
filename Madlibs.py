madlib = f"The day had begun on a {adj} note. The sun finally \
peeked through the rain for the first time in a week, and the \
birds were {adj1} in its warmth. There was no way to anticipate \
what was about to happen. It was a worst-case {adj2} and there \
was no way out of it.\

of an intelligent {adj4} and the braincase of a man, you'll have a \
rough idea of what they looked like -- {adj5} for their teeth. \
The canines would have fitted better in the face of a {adj6}, and \
showed at the corners of {adj7} wide, thin-lipped mouths, giving {adj8} \
an expression of ferocity."
